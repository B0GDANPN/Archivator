 * @brief Audio compression algorithm inspired by FLAC (lossless compression for WAV audio).
 *
 * Implements a simplified FLAC-like compression for 16-bit PCM mono WAV files using linear predictive coding (LPC) and Rice coding. The algorithm reads a WAV file, computes LPC coefficients for blocks of audio samples, encodes the coefficients and residuals using Rice codes, and writes a compressed file with ".flac" extension (not standard FLAC format, but a custom binary format).
